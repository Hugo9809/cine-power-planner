Suggestions prioritize direct feature and device matches before help topics so navigation lands on controls first. Each entry shows whether it opens a Feature, Action, Device or Help topic so you know what happens before pressing Enter. Exact matches and items you've used recently jump to the top automatically, so your go-to controls stay first. Every suggestion also includes a short description so you can confirm what it will do at a glance. Search also reads the same tooltip and help text shown around controls, so words like \"JSON\" or \"autosave\" still land on the right button even if the label differs. Small typos are forgiven too, so \"bakcup\" still finds Backup or Save. Connector and media abbreviations like \"USB-C\", \"Micro-HDMI\", \"SDXC\", \"CFexpress\", \"V-Mount\" or \"D-Tap\" automatically match their full names, so type whichever version you remember. Exposure and color vocabulary is linked the same way—ISO, EI, ASA, exposure index, ND or neutral density, and WB, white balance or color temperature terms all resolve together so any phrasing points to the right controls. Press Enter to navigate, / or Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on Mac) to focus the search from anywhere, use Escape or × to clear the query, and notice how clearing the field floats your most recently used matches to the top for faster repeats. Prefix your query with \"feature\", \"action\", \"device\" or \"help\" (or your localized equivalents) (for example, \"help: battery\") to filter suggestions to that type. Start with \"recent\" or \"history\" (or your localized equivalents) (for example, \"recent iso\") to search only items you've used lately before scanning the full catalog. Wrap any phrase in double quotes to force an exact match, so typing \"battery health\" with quotes jumps ahead of broader matches. Common filler words are ignored automatically, so conversational questions like \"how do I back up\" still surface the important keywords.",
