The Semantic Code Mandate: All new or modified code must be accompanied by clear, meaningful comments for complex logic, public interfaces, and non-obvious implementation details. Comments should prioritize explaining the intent ("why") rather than just the action ("what") to ensure the codebase remains maintainable and transparent for all contributors.
