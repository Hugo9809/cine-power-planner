# Walkthrough: help-save-share-backup

## Scope
V2 help content and translations for save/share/backup/restore/offline data integrity messaging.

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed V2 settings and project export/import controls to match labels for backups, restore rehearsal, and JSON share flows.
2. Added a dedicated V2 help topic covering manual save, autosave, auto-backups, export/import conflicts, full backup/restore, and offline guarantees.
3. Localized the new help topic across all supported translation files.

## Result
Help content now documents offline save/share/backup/restore safety in a dedicated, localized V2 topic aligned with the current UI labels.
