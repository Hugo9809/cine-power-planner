# Implementation Plan - codex

## Goal
Update storage-related documentation to reflect the StorageRepository flow (localStorage boot, IndexedDB primary, OPFS snapshots where supported) across user, ops, and dev guides.

## Steps
1. Update user guide storage references (workflow table, system requirements, storage safety paragraph).
2. Update ops checklists to inspect IndexedDB and OPFS alongside localStorage.
3. Update dev architecture docs to describe StorageRepository boot and migration flow.
4. Validate wording stays offline-first, data-safe, and avoids external links.

## Status
