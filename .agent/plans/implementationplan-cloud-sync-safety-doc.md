# Implementation Plan: cloud-sync-safety-doc

## Goal
Create offline-ready documentation for the planned optional cloud sync feature and link it from all documentation indexes and localized READMEs.

## Steps
1. Draft the new user doc outlining local-first sync behavior, pre-flight steps, offline behavior, recovery steps, and verification checklist.
2. Link the new doc in `docs/README.md` under “Users & crew.”
3. Update `README.md` and localized READMEs to reference the new doc and mark cloud sync as a future update.
4. Review for offline-only language and consistency with data protection guidance.
