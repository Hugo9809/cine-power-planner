# Implementation Plan: storage-language-update

## Goal
Update documentation to clarify IndexedDB as the primary store, OPFS for backups, and localStorage as legacy migration/compatibility fallback only.

## Steps
1. Review documentation sections that describe storage behavior and identify legacy wording.
2. Update dev and user docs to reflect IndexedDB-first storage with OPFS backups and localStorage fallback for migration/compatibility only.
3. Verify documentation consistency across updated files.

## Status
- [x] Completed
