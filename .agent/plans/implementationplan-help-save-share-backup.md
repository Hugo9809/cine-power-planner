# Implementation Plan: help-save-share-backup

## Goal
Add a dedicated V2 help topic that documents save/autosave/auto-backup behavior, JSON export/import with conflict handling, backup/restore (including rehearsal), and offline data integrity guarantees, localized across all languages.

## Steps
1. Review V2 Settings, project export/import controls, and existing help content to align labels and flows.
2. Add a new V2 help topic entry plus localized strings in every translation file.
3. Verify wording stays offline-only and matches data-protection messaging.

## Status
- [x] Completed
