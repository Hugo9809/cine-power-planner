# Verification Log Template

Use this template during every rehearsal, audit or release verification. Store
completed copies with backups, bundles, translation exports and documentation
packets so future crews can reconstruct evidence offline.

## Session details

- **Date & time:**
- **Location / workstation:** _(include browser version, OS, offline status)_
- **Participants:**
- **Runtime revision:** _(git commit / bundle hash)_
- **Docs revision:** _(list updated markdown/README commits)_

## Workflows exercised

| Workflow | Result (Pass/Fail) | Evidence (file/path) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manual save |  |  |  |
| Autosave cadence |  |  |  |
| Planner backup export |  |  |  |
| Planner backup restore (sandbox) |  |  |  |
| Project share & import |  |  |  |
| Automatic gear preset rehearsal |  |  |  |
| Documentation sync check |  |  |  |
| Offline cache reset |  |  |  |
| Translation verification |  |  |  |

_Add rows as required for specialised drills (e.g. legal notices, accessibility)._ 

## Issues discovered

| ID | Description | Impact (data risk/usability/docs) | Immediate mitigation | Follow-up reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

_Log follow-up references in [Review Findings](review-findings.md) and
[Review Tasks](review-tasks-2025-02-07.md)._ 

## Attachments

List filenames for backups, bundles, translation exports, screenshots, console
logs and documentation updates generated during this session. Note storage media
(primary/offsite) for each file.

## Sign-off

- **Recorder name:**
- **Signature / initials:**
- **QA approval:** _(name/date)_
- **Localisation approval (if applicable):** _(name/date)_

Complete logs provide auditable proof that save/share/import/backup/restore
safeguards behaved correctly while offline.
