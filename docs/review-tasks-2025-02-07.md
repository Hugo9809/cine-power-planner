# Review Tasks – 2025-02-07 Cycle

Use this tracker to manage outstanding tasks from the 7 Feb 2025 review. Update
entries as work progresses and link to supporting evidence stored offline.

| ID | Description | Priority | Owner | Status | Evidence reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TASK-001 | _(e.g. Add checksum display to restore sandbox)_ | High | _(Name)_ | _(In progress)_ | _(Verification packet path)_ |
| TASK-002 |  |  |  |  |  |

## Workflow

1. When logging a finding in `review-findings.md`, create a matching task here.
2. Store rehearsal evidence (screenshots, logs, backups) in the verification
   packet and reference the path.
3. Update related docs (operations checklist, save/share reference, translations)
   as you work; note commit hashes once merged.
4. Close tasks only after running the [Operations Checklist](operations-checklist.md)
   and confirming documentation, translations and offline behaviour all match.
5. Archive the updated tracker with the release documentation packet.
