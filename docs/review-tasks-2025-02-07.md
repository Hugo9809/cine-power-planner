# Review Tasks Tracker

Use this tracker to log follow-up actions from reviews, drills or audits. Update
it whenever new items are discovered and close tasks only after evidence is
archived.

| Date opened | Task | Source review | Owner | Due date | Status | Evidence link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Notes

- Reference verification logs, documentation commits or backup filenames in the
  evidence column.
- If a task involves changes to save/share/import/backup/restore workflows,
  ensure the [Documentation Update Checklist](documentation-update-checklist.md)
  is completed before closure.
- Keep the tracker in the same repository as the documentation so offline crews
  can review it without connectivity.
