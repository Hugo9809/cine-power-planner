# Review Tasks – 2025-02-07

## Fix typo in gear list provenance
- **Issue**: The provenance note for the Sony DVF-EL200 viewfinder references a PDF named `Equpment`, leaving a visible spelling mistake in the in-app dataset.
- **Impact**: Offline crews exporting or printing gear lists see the typo in audit trails, which looks unprofessional and can cause confusion when verifying source documents.
- **Recommended task**: Rename the provenance reference to use `Equipment` instead of `Equpment` and mirror the correction wherever the string appears in legacy data bundles. 【F:src/data/devices/gearList.js†L1-L27】

## Guard deep-freeze fallback when WeakSet is unavailable (bug)
- **Issue**: `fallbackFreezeDeep` instantiates `new WeakSet()` as a default parameter. Browsers without `WeakSet` throw before the guard logic runs, breaking storage safeguards in older offline profiles despite the accompanying comment promising legacy resilience. 【F:src/scripts/modules/context.js†L101-L136】
- **Impact**: On legacy devices the module fails to load, jeopardising autosave and backup flows that depend on the context helpers to protect user data.
- **Recommended task**: Lazily create the tracking collection inside the function, falling back to a simple array when `WeakSet` is missing so the freeze helper keeps working on older browsers.

## Correct review doc that claims duplicate-key tests are missing (documentation discrepancy)
- **Issue**: `docs/review-findings.md` still reports that no automated test guards against duplicate optical properties, but the repository now includes `tests/data/gearListDuplicateKeys.test.js` which enforces exactly that invariant. 【F:docs/review-findings.md†L10-L23】【F:tests/data/gearListDuplicateKeys.test.js†L1-L90】
- **Impact**: Contributors waste time chasing a resolved gap and may mistrust other review notes when auditing offline safety tooling.
- **Recommended task**: Update the review findings to reflect the existing duplicate-key coverage (or replace the entry with any still-open data integrity gaps).

## Add regression test for WeakSet-free environments (test improvement)
- **Issue**: No unit test simulates loading the context module without `WeakSet`, so the brittle default-parameter instantiation could regress without detection. 【F:src/scripts/modules/context.js†L101-L136】
- **Impact**: Future changes might reintroduce the legacy breakage, risking offline autosave guards on older browsers without early warning.
- **Recommended task**: Extend the module harness tests to stub out `WeakSet`, load the module and assert `fallbackFreezeDeep` still deep-freezes objects without throwing, ensuring the guard remains intact.
