# Review Tasks Tracker

Use this tracker to log follow-up actions from reviews, drills or audits. Update
it whenever new items are discovered and close tasks only after evidence is
archived.

| Date opened | Task | Source review | Owner | Due date | Status | Evidence link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Notes

- Reference verification logs, documentation commits, translation exports or
  backup filenames in the evidence column.
- If a task touches save/share/import/backup/restore workflows or translations,
  complete the [Documentation Update Checklist](documentation-update-checklist.md)
  before closure.
- Keep the tracker in the repository so offline crews can review it without
  connectivity.
- When closing tasks, update the [Review Findings Log](review-findings.md) with
  the resolution details.
