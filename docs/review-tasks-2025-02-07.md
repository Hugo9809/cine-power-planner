# Review Tasks â€“ 2025-02-07 Cycle

Use this tracker to manage outstanding tasks from the 7 Feb 2025 review. Update
entries as work progresses and link to supporting evidence stored offline.

| ID | Description | Priority | Owner | Status | Evidence reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TASK-001 | Regenerate `service-worker-assets.js` so cached schema/runtime helpers stay available offline. | High | Automated QA | Complete | service-worker-assets.js; `npm run test:jest -- service-worker` log |
| TASK-002 | Align testing plan with `npm run generate:sw-assets` command to keep cache manifest updated. | Medium | Automated QA | Complete | docs/testing-plan.md |
| TASK-003 | Correct the French onboarding string that reads "la diagnostic" to the grammatically correct "le diagnostic". | Low | TBD | Open | `src/scripts/translations.js` L8638-L8646 |
| TASK-004 | Restore deep-freeze behaviour in `environment-bridge` so Node builds no longer skip freezing due to the unconditional `process.release.name === 'node'` check. | High | TBD | Open | `src/scripts/modules/environment-bridge.js` L136-L169 |
| TASK-005 | Update the testing plan entry for `npm test` so it documents the lint and consistency checks executed before Jest. | Medium | TBD | Open | docs/testing-plan.md L8-L14; package.json L8-L15 |
| TASK-006 | Extend `environment-bridge` unit tests to assert nested objects are frozen under Node, preventing regressions where `freezeDeep` returns unfrozen structures. | Medium | TBD | Open | tests/unit/environmentBridge.test.js |
| TASK-007 | Fix the "co-ordinate" typo in `context.js` so shared runtime comments match documentation terminology. | Low | TBD | Open | `src/scripts/modules/context.js` L2-L9 |
| TASK-008 | Update the service worker asset manifest generator to include the `docs/` directory so offline help/drill files load when cached builds run without connectivity. | Medium | TBD | Open | `tools/serviceWorkerAssetManifest.js` L22-L41 |
| TASK-009 | Expand the `npm test` entry in `docs/testing-plan.md` to note that Jest runs unit, data and DOM projects, matching `jest.config.js`. | Medium | TBD | Open | `docs/testing-plan.md` L8-L12; `jest.config.js` L12-L21 |
| TASK-010 | Strengthen `storage-alert` tests to assert the fallback alert copy (and session flag) so regressions in user-facing warnings are caught. | Medium | TBD | Open | `tests/unit/storage-alert.test.js` L152-L176; `src/scripts/storage.js` L6648-L6671 |
| TASK-011 | Update `docs/save-share-restore-reference.md` with the new redundant autosave/backups guard notes introduced during the runtime helper split. | Medium | TBD | Open | `docs/save-share-restore-reference.md` L18-L47 |
| TASK-012 | Sync `docs/documentation-update-checklist.md` with the current backup rotation rehearsal steps so operators rehearse redundant exports before hand-off. | Medium | TBD | Open | `docs/documentation-update-checklist.md` L9-L42; `docs/backup-rotation-guide.md` L12-L48 |

## Workflow

1. When logging a finding in `review-findings.md`, create a matching task here.
2. Store rehearsal evidence (screenshots, logs, backups) in the verification
   packet and reference the path.
3. Update related docs (operations checklist, save/share reference, translations)
   as you work; note commit hashes once merged.
4. Close tasks only after running the [Operations Checklist](operations-checklist.md)
   and confirming documentation, translations and offline behaviour all match.
5. Archive the updated tracker with the release documentation packet.
6. Attach fresh planner backups, project bundles and checksum logs to the packet so offline restores remain fully rehearsed.
