# Review Findings Log

Record outcomes from documentation, workflow and offline rehearsals. Keep entries
chronological and link them to supporting evidence.

## Entry template

- **Date:**
- **Review type:** (Operations checklist, offline drill, documentation audit,
  translation review, incident response, release sign-off.)
- **Participants:**
- **Summary:** (Key observations, issues discovered, successes.)
- **Evidence archived:** (Verification log filename, backup checksum, screenshot
  bundle, translation export.)
- **Follow-up tasks:** (List items and owners. Copy to
  [Review Tasks](review-tasks-2025-02-07.md).)
- **Status:** (Open / In progress / Resolved.)

## Guidance

- Keep logs factual and precise. If data was restored from a backup, note which
  file, timestamp and checksum were used.
- Reference relevant documentation updates, translation commits or service worker
  changes.
- When closing tasks, record where updated artefacts live (new planner backup
  location, documentation packet path, translation archive).

A thorough log provides traceability during audits and helps future crews
understand how issues were resolved.
