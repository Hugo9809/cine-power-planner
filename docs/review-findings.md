# Review Findings Log

Record outcomes from documentation, workflow and offline rehearsals. Keep entries
chronological and link them to supporting evidence.

## Entry template

- **Date:**
- **Review type:** (Operations checklist, offline drill, documentation audit,
  incident review, release sign-off.)
- **Participants:**
- **Summary:** (Key observations, issues discovered, successes.)
- **Evidence archived:** (Verification log filename, backup checksum, screenshot
  bundle.)
- **Follow-up tasks:** (List items and owners. Copy to
  [Review Tasks](review-tasks-2025-02-07.md).)
- **Status:** (Open / In progress / Resolved.)

## Guidance

- Keep logs factual and precise. If data was restored from a backup, note which
  file and timestamp were used.
- Reference relevant documentation updates or translation commits.
- When closing tasks, record where the updated artefacts live (e.g. new planner
  backup location, updated documentation packet path).

A thorough log provides traceability during audits and helps future crews
understand how issues were resolved.
