# Module Registry Architecture

The Cine Power Planner runtime now routes every critical bundle through the
`cineModules` registry. The registry is a frozen map that lives on
`globalThis.cineModules` and inside `src/scripts/modules/registry.js`. Each
module registers itself during evaluation and is validated by
`cineRuntime.verifyCriticalFlows()` before the UI accepts user actions. This
chapter explains the contracts, metadata and maintenance checklist so the
offline-first guarantees (save, autosave, share, import, backup and restore)
remain intact.

## Why a registry?

The planner was split into several defensive modules (`cinePersistence`,
`cineOffline`, `cineUi`, `cineCoreShared`, `cineRuntime`) to isolate
responsibilities. Prior to this change, consumers relied on globals or manual
`require()` calls. The registry promotes the modular architecture to a first
class concept:

- **Deterministic lookups.** Modules are frozen and retrievable by name, so a
  component cannot accidentally consume an outdated global reference.
- **Metadata auditing.** The registry stores category, description, timestamp
  and freeze status for every module. Integrity reports surface this metadata to
  aid troubleshooting during offline rehearsals.
- **Integrity verification.** `cineRuntime.verifyCriticalFlows()` now inspects
  registry membership before checking method availability. A missing registration
  fails the same guard that protects save/share/restore flows and the runtime
  feedback storage wrappers and bindings.
- **Legacy parity.** The ES5 bundle under `legacy/` mirrors the registry so
  older browsers and cached offline copies keep the same guarantees.

## Modules registered by default

Before the feature-specific modules are evaluated we register
`cineModuleArchitectureHelpers`, a compact infrastructure layer that exposes
deterministic scope detection, registry resolution, queue management, deep
freezing and safe logging primitives to every environment. `cineModuleBase`
builds on those helpers to provide the historical base API, while
`cineModuleContext` mirrors the primitives inside the module system so
consumers can resolve registries and queue fallbacks without reimplementing the
boilerplate. Finally `cineModuleEnvironment` provides a frozen bridge that
reuses the context helpers across every modern bundle so modules stop copying
plumbing when they talk to the registry or the global scope. The legacy bundle
exposes the same quartet so parity can be maintained as we sync future updates
across both builds.

## Architecture factory

The defensive helpers that power `cineModuleArchitectureHelpers`,
`cineModuleBase`, `cineModuleContext` and `cineModuleEnvironment` are now also
available through
`cineModuleArchitectureFactory.createModuleArchitecture(options)`. The factory
creates frozen architecture instances with the same queue, scope-detection and
deep-freeze behaviour that the primary runtime uses. This is especially useful
when a feature needs to spin up a sandboxed environment (for example, a shared
worker used during offline rehearsals) without mutating the main global scope.

- **Scoped isolation.** Pass `{ primaryScope }` to create an architecture bound
  to an alternative global-like object. The helper still respects the
  persistence and queue semantics that protect save/share/restore pathways so
  user data remains safe even in auxiliary contexts.
- **Deterministic helpers.** The factory mirrors `tryRequire`,
  `collectCandidateScopes`, `ensureQueue`, `freezeDeep` and `safeWarn`, keeping
  every environment aligned with the behaviour documented for the primary
  module registry.
- **Automatic availability.** The factory lives on
  `globalThis.cineModuleArchitectureFactory` and piggybacks on the offline
  asset list. No network access is required, and the existing service worker
  continues to ship the script alongside local Uicons, fonts and help content.

| Module name        | Category          | Responsibilities |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `cineModuleArchitectureHelpers` | `infrastructure` | Shares frozen scope detection, registry resolution, queue management, deep freezing and safe warning helpers so every environment starts from the same defensive baseline. |
| `cineModuleBase`   | `infrastructure`  | Normalises scope detection, module registration queues, deep freezing and safe global exposure so higher level modules share the same defensive primitives. |
| `cineModuleContext` | `infrastructure` | Shares base helpers with the module system, exposing unified context factories so modules can resolve architecture hooks, registries and queue fallbacks without reimplementing them. |
| `cineModuleEnvironment` | `infrastructure` | Provides a shared runtime context that mirrors `cineModuleBase` and `cineModuleContext` helpers, keeping registry access, queuing and global exposure aligned between files without duplicating the handshake logic. |
| `cineCoreShared`   | `shared`          | Stable stringify helpers, connector summaries, auto-gear weight normalization, version marker exposure. |
| `cinePersistence`  | `persistence`     | Storage accessors, autosave helpers, backup/export/import orchestration, share/restore bridges. |
| `cineOffline`      | `offline`         | Service worker registration, cache rebuilds, fallback storage cleanup, reload triggers. |
| `cineUi`           | `ui`              | Controller/interaction/help registries for dialogs, backups, restore rehearsals and share workflows. |
| `cineFeaturePrint` | `feature`         | Frozen print orchestration helpers that coordinate native printing and fallback windows so overview exports remain reliable offline. |
| `cineRuntime`      | `runtime`         | Aggregates modules, exposes integrity checks and ensures every safeguard stays frozen. |

The registry is extensible: additional modules may be registered to expose
purpose-specific APIs, but every entry must honour the guarantees below.

## Registration contract

1. **Freeze by default.** `registry.register(name, api)` freezes the supplied
   object unless `options.freeze === false`. Use the default freeze to prevent
   accidental mutation of shared state.
2. **Metadata is mandatory.** Provide `category` and `description` to document
   how the module supports user data protection. These strings appear in
   integrity reports and documentation. You can also include a
   `connections` array listing other modules that the new entry depends on
   (for example, `['cineModuleBase', 'cineModuleContext']`). The runtime uses
   these relationships to validate cross-module wiring without mutating the
   registry.
3. **One name, one module.** Registering an already-registered name throws
   unless `options.replace === true`. Replacements are intended for controlled
   overrides (tests, feature flags) and should remain rare.
4. **Reset only in tests.** `__internalResetForTests({ force: true })` exists to
   isolate Jest suites. Do not call it in production code.

## Adding a new module

1. Implement the module under `src/scripts/modules/`. Keep the file frozen under
   25â€¯000 lines and follow existing patterns (defensive try/catch when reading
   globals, no external network calls, offline-first defaults).
2. Require the registry via `require('./registry.js')` (with a `tryRequire`
   helper) and register the module with category/description metadata.
3. Update `src/scripts/script.js`, `legacy/scripts/script.js`, `loader.js` and
   `service-worker.js` to preload/cache the new module so offline usage stays
   reliable.
4. Add tests covering registration and the exposed API. Place unit tests in
   `tests/unit/` and use `registry.__internalResetForTests({ force: true })` to
   isolate state.
5. Update documentation and translations:
   - Reference the new module in this file and the localized READMEs.
   - Ensure in-app help/translation strings still describe save/share/restore
     flows accurately.
6. Run `npm test` before committing to confirm ESLint, data checks and Jest all
   pass. Capture a fresh `window.cineRuntime.verifyCriticalFlows()` report during
   manual QA to verify the registry entries.

## Maintenance checklist

Whenever you modify a registered module:

- **Offline parity.** Confirm the service worker asset list contains the module
  for both modern and legacy bundles. All assets must load without network
  access (remember to keep local Uicons, fonts and animations intact).
- **Backwards compatibility.** Preserve existing method names and semantics so
  saved data, backups and shares continue to round-trip without loss.
- **Documentation.** Update READMEs, docs and translations with any new
  behaviour so crews rehearsing offline always follow accurate guidance.
- **Integrity verification.** Re-run `npm run test:unit` and, if possible,
  execute `npm run test:script` to ensure the runtime guard recognises the new
  module boundaries.
- **Connection audit.** Run `window.cineRuntime.inspectModuleConnections()` in
  the browser console (or call the exported function in tests) to confirm the
  new module reports accurate dependencies and that every connection resolves
  to a registered module.
- **Backups first.** When in doubt, err on the side of capturing additional user
  data (extra autosaves, more detailed backups) instead of removing fields. User
  data must never be lost because of a module change.

Following this checklist keeps the modular architecture a core component of the
app while safeguarding the offline, privacy-first workflow that crews rely on.
