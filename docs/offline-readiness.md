# Offline Readiness Runbook

This runbook prepares crews to operate Cine Power Planner without connectivity.
Complete it before travel days, off-site shoots or any event requiring
air-gapped workflows.

## Pre-travel checklist

- [ ] Clone the repository or unpack the offline bundle onto two separate
      machines.
- [ ] Launch `index.html` once per machine to warm caches, then disconnect the
      network and verify functionality.
- [ ] Open **Help → Start Here** and complete the offline readiness quick check
      to verify the Data & Storage dashboard timestamps, persistent storage
      status, redundant backups and rehearsal coverage before travelling.
- [ ] Toggle the browser’s offline mode and confirm the top banner announces
      that force reload requires connectivity while the header reload control
      remains disabled. This ensures caches and service workers stay intact
      until a connection is restored.
- [ ] While still in developer tools, watch the reload connectivity probe: it
      now appends a `__cineReloadProbe__` token and expects
      `x-cine-connectivity-probe-result: network`. When offline you should see
      the response marked `fallback`, confirming the service worker protected
      caches and blocked the reload. The service worker now ignores probe query
      tokens when looking up cached shells so degraded reload attempts still
      deliver the annotated fallback instead of failing outright.
- [ ] Export planner backups and project bundles; store copies on redundant
      physical media.
- [ ] Print essential docs (operations checklist, save/share reference,
      translation guide) for offline reference.
- [ ] Verify icons, fonts and Uicons load locally by inspecting the network
      panel while offline (should show no remote requests).

## Field kit inventory

| Item | Quantity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Laptops/workstations | 2+ | Each loaded with warm cache and rehearsal project. |
| External storage | 3 | Rotating backups (primary, onsite spare, offsite). |
| Printed docs | 1 set per crew | Include translations as needed. |
| Power adapters & surge protection | 1 per workstation | Prevent data corruption from power loss. |
| Offline verification packet | 2 copies | Stored with production and safety lead. |

## On-site routine

1. **Start of day** – Run manual save, export project bundle, confirm autosave
   ledger is healthy.
2. **Midday** – Rotate backups to second storage device; record actions in
   `review-findings.md`.
3. **End of day** – Run the [Backup Rotation Guide](backup-rotation-guide.md)
   steps, update verification logs and store evidence securely.
4. **Incident drills** – Weekly, perform a restore rehearsal using the sandbox
   on a spare machine to confirm backups remain healthy.

## Emergency recovery

- If a workstation fails, use the spare machine and restore the latest planner
  backup. Promote sandbox data only after exporting diff logs from **Settings →
  Backup & Restore → Compare versions** and reviewing the changes.
- If both primary and onsite backups fail, retrieve the offsite copy documented
  in the verification packet.
- Document incidents in the [Data Protection Playbook](data-protection-playbook.md)
  incident response section and follow escalation procedures.

## Post-mission wrap-up

- Consolidate backups, verification packets and updated docs into the archival
  storage location.
- Update README translations with lessons learned if workflows changed.
- Schedule a documentation audit to confirm no drift occurred during the field
  period.
