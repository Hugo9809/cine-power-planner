# Save, Share, Import, Backup & Restore Reference

This reference condenses the critical workflows that protect user data in Cine Power Planner. Use it alongside the [Operational Checklist](operations-checklist.md) and the [Offline Readiness Runbook](offline-readiness.md) whenever you need to confirm the app still saves, shares, imports, backs up and restores entirely offline.

The application exposes these routines through the frozen `cinePersistence` gateway, which mirrors the storage, backup, restore and share helpers defined in code so browsers cannot mutate them accidentally.【F:src/scripts/modules/persistence.js†L90-L171】 A runtime guard records the most recent verification result on `window.__cineRuntimeIntegrity`, and the guard can be re-run manually through `window.cineRuntime.verifyCriticalFlows()` if you need a fresh report while auditing documentation or drills. The inspection now explicitly confirms that runtime feedback storage wrappers and bindings are present alongside the existing save/share/restore safeguards, and it additionally checks the auto-gear seed flag along with storage guard utilities so cache purges, retention defaults and persistent storage requests remain reachable.【F:src/scripts/script.js†L93-L184】【F:tests/dom/runtimeIntegration.test.js†L58-L87】【F:src/scripts/modules/runtime.js†L16-L80】

A compatibility watchdog upgrades any legacy project payloads on sight. When the reader encounters a single-project export, an array of unnamed saves, or a legacy project object, the importer now renames the recovered entry with an `-updated` suffix before persisting it in the normalized structure. Existing normalized saves keep their names, while upgraded copies automatically receive unique suffixed titles so they never overwrite recent work. This ensures every restored project inherits the modern field layout, autosave routines and backup hooks without dropping historical data.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L2834-L2881】【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L4336-L4457】

A long-running editing session no longer forces frequent full-project snapshots: automatic backups now track up to 50 tracked changes between two fully saved versions before the planner captures a fresh complete copy, spreading the retention budget across more restore points without sacrificing coverage for legacy Long GOP metadata.【F:src/scripts/app-events.js†L90-L209】【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L2923-L2980】 Project switches, imports, exports and reload preparation still force an immediate snapshot so transitions cannot outrun the safety net even when that cadence has not elapsed.【F:src/scripts/app-events.js†L63-L209】 The scheduler also skips work when the setup signature hasn't changed since the last snapshot, reusing the latest auto backup instead of rewriting identical data so background cycles stay responsive without giving up restore coverage.【F:src/scripts/app-events.js†L1500-L1638】

A silent guard now also captures unnamed in-progress sessions: autosave writes the gear list, requirements, diagram positions and auto-gear rules to the shared project store even when no setup name has been entered, and the restore flow looks up the anonymous slot while rebuilding the form after a reload.【F:src/scripts/app-setups.js†L4976-L5037】【F:src/scripts/app-session.js†L3143-L3163】 The active setup itself stays stored in plain JSON while selected, with compression guards keeping the live key and its safety snapshots unwrapped even after long sessions so the next reload never depends on recovery logic before presenting the latest edits.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L2728-L2847】【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L2869-L2966】

Custom gear rows added from the new per-category controls live inside that same gear selector map, so downloads, share bundles, backups and restores replay every custom quantity and label even when crews leave a placeholder blank while drafting lists.【F:src/scripts/app-setups.js†L5042-L5082】【F:src/scripts/app-setups.js†L5084-L5098】

A dedicated storage guardian runs on every launch to mirror each critical key into its backup slot before the UI touches data, ensuring that even legacy entries have a redundant copy ready before rehearsals or imports begin.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L247-L376】【F:src/scripts/app-session.js†L10017-L10024】 The latest guard report is exposed globally so you can confirm the mirroring state from diagnostics panels.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L347-L358】【F:src/scripts/app-core-new-2.js†L6266-L6349】

The loader now also inspects the long-term migration backups that we capture before every normalization. When both the primary slot and its live backup go missing, the recovery routine decompresses the preserved `__legacyMigrationBackup` payload, validates it against the expected schema, rewrites the primary key (compressing the payload again when possible) and logs the recovery so the diagnostics panel documents the intervention without forcing users to re-import data manually.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L4516-L4756】

When the browser reports a quota error, the persistence layer now runs a compression sweep across existing planner keys before it ever considers downgrading to in-memory storage. The sweep skips the active key and its backup, squeezes long-lived saves down with the same UTF-16 wrapper used for new writes, prioritises the largest reclaimable entries first, and logs how many characters were reclaimed so crews can verify the reclamation in diagnostics without losing a single unique backup snapshot.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L690-L1004】【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L1541-L1652】【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L2976-L3155】

If a project save still hits the quota after that sweep, the writer now escalates the active attempt itself to the same UTF-16 compression wrapper instead of abandoning the write. The primary slot and its live backup both switch to the compressed form during that retry, guaranteeing the payload lands without deleting unique automatic snapshots and documenting the savings in diagnostics so crews can confirm the recovery succeeded offline.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L4855-L5365】

The **Diagnostics log** inside **Settings → Data & Storage** exposes those cineLogging entries in the UI. Teams can filter by severity or namespace and adjust retention, console mirroring, session persistence and global error capture without leaving the planner, keeping verification artifacts local even when offline. The panel now flags when filters hide every entry so you can confirm the quiet periods are intentional before escalating an incident.【F:index.html†L2590-L2649】【F:src/scripts/app-session.js†L6672-L6687】【F:src/scripts/translations.js†L760-L786】 Each entry now stores an ISO timestamp, millisecond marker, event ID and channel indicator so crews can correlate console fallbacks with stored diagnostics even if the structured logger cannot initialize.【F:src/scripts/overview.js†L89-L214】 Overview print and export attempts now emit their warnings and fallback usage into this log so share rehearsals record exactly when the dialog needed to open the backup window.【F:src/scripts/overview.js†L705-L824】

**Quick safeguards** live beside that log inside **Settings → Data & Storage**, giving crews a one-click path to download a fresh full backup or jump directly to the restore workspace without leaving the dialog. Every time you press the button the planner records the action in the same storage dashboard, making it easy to archive the JSON alongside the verification note.【F:index.html†L2548-L2570】

The logging serializers now retain detail from Maps, Sets, typed arrays, URL parameters and regular expressions so incident reviews capture the full context without chasing down reproduced payloads. Map entries and typed array previews truncate with explicit counters when the payload is large, keeping diagnostics responsive while still documenting how much data the runtime handled.【F:src/scripts/modules/logging.js†L712-L901】

## Workflow matrix

| Workflow | Primary controls (UI/Keyboard) | What success looks like | Evidence to capture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manual save | Project header → **Save** or `Enter` / `Ctrl+S` / `⌘S` | Project appears in selector with updated timestamp, `auto-backup-…` snapshot joins within 10 minutes or immediately after a project switch/import/export | Screenshot or timestamp log of selector, note `window.__cineRuntimeIntegrity.ok === true` |
| Autosave confirmation | Stay on project for 10 minutes or trigger a project switch/import/export, watch selector or **Settings → Backup & Restore** overlay | New `auto-backup-…` entry listed, overlay reports latest autosave time | Capture overlay text, promote entry to manual save if needed |
| Quick safeguards backup | **Settings → Data & Storage → Quick safeguards → Download full backup** | `planner-backup.json` downloads immediately and the storage dashboard logs the action | Store the JSON on redundant media and record the dashboard entry ID |
| Planner backup export | **Settings → Backup & Restore → Backup** | Browser downloads `planner-backup.json` (or opens Manual download tab if blocked) | File stored on redundant media, checksum recorded, runtime guard check logged |
| Project bundle export | **Share → Export project bundle** (rename to `.cpproject` if required) | Download includes project data, favorites and custom devices | File stored twice, verification note referencing isolation import |
| Restore rehearsal | **Settings → Backup & Restore → Restore rehearsal** → load chosen backup | Sandbox diff shows expected changes, proceed restores data without touching live profile | Console log of rehearsal result, note pre-restore snapshot filename |
| Full restore | **Settings → Backup & Restore → Restore** after rehearsal succeeds | App reloads with restored data, pre-restore snapshot stored automatically | Archive restored backup, pre-restore snapshot ID and post-restore verification notes |
| Share link/application | **Share → Copy share link** or **Share → Apply shared setup** | Import prompt validates payload, offers rollback on mismatch | Note validation message, keep copy of imported payload for incident review |
| Version comparison audit | **Settings → Backup & Restore → Compare versions** | Diff summary matches expected edits and nothing unexpected appears in the detailed list | Exported JSON log stored with backups plus verification note referencing the compared versions |

Applying a shared setup removes only the `shared` query flag from the URL, preserving any other query parameters or hash fragments so language overrides and anchored navigation stay intact after import.【F:src/scripts/app-session.js†L2375-L2453】

Version comparisons create a documented paper trail before archives rotate. Launch **Settings → Backup & Restore → Compare versions**, pick a baseline manual save plus the latest auto backup, confirm the summary mirrors your expectations, review each list entry for unexpected additions or removals, then record context in **Incident notes** before exporting the log. Store the JSON alongside your backups and reference the filename in your verification ledger so future audits can replay the diff offline.【F:index.html†L3684-L3754】【F:src/scripts/translations.js†L620-L657】

### Factory reset safeguards

Factory reset is the only workflow that clears auto backups, manual saves and preferences in one sweep, so the planner refuses to erase anything until it has captured a fresh full backup. When you confirm the reset, the runtime invokes the same `createSettingsBackup()` routine used by the **Download full backup** button. If the export is blocked or the download fails, the wipe is cancelled and your data stays put, guaranteeing a restorable copy exists before anything is deleted.【F:src/scripts/app-session.js†L6999-L7056】【F:src/scripts/app-session.js†L8765-L8797】

Once the backup lands successfully, the reset proceeds to run `clearAllData()`, which now wipes every key from local storage and session storage—covering planner data, preferences, diagnostics history and any lingering session flags. Because the pre-reset export contains those entries, you can immediately reopen the planner and restore the downloaded file to recover auto backups or manual saves that were cleared from the browser profile.【F:src/scripts/storage.js†L9798-L9887】

## Console & script checks

Run these quick inspections while documenting or rehearsing the workflows above:

1. `window.__cineRuntimeIntegrity` – confirms the latest integrity report and highlights any missing persistence, offline or UI safeguards, including runtime feedback storage coverage.【F:src/scripts/script.js†L121-L184】【F:src/scripts/modules/runtime.js†L16-L69】
2. `window.cineRuntime.verifyCriticalFlows({ warnOnFailure: true })` – refreshes the guard and surfaces which modules or functions failed validation, matching the expectations enforced by the integration suite and catching missing feedback persistence immediately.【F:tests/dom/runtimeIntegration.test.js†L58-L87】【F:tests/unit/runtimeModule.test.js†L402-L460】
3. `window.cineRuntime.inspectModuleConnections()` – returns a frozen report describing every registered module, their declared connections and any missing dependencies so you can audit module wiring before rehearsals.【F:src/scripts/modules/runtime.js†L1020-L1199】
4. `window.cinePersistence.__internal.inspectAllBindings()` – snapshots every persistence wrapper, confirming autosave, backup, restore and share helpers all resolve to concrete implementations before you rehearse critical flows.【F:src/scripts/modules/persistence.js†L239-L406】【F:src/scripts/modules/runtime.js†L300-L390】
5. `window.cinePersistence.storage.exportAllData()` – returns the same payload used for planner backups so you can sanity-check file size, project counts and timestamps without triggering a download.【F:src/scripts/modules/persistence.js†L90-L145】
6. `window.cinePersistence.share.decodeSharedSetup(payload)` – validates bundle text before you import it into production data. Pair it with `window.cinePersistence.share.applySharedSetup()` inside a disposable profile to confirm recovery paths stay healthy.【F:src/scripts/modules/persistence.js†L152-L157】
7. `typeof window.getMountVoltagePreferencesClone === 'function'` – confirms the runtime re-exposed the mount voltage clone helper that share/import flows depend on so every backup retains the latest mount voltage overrides.【F:src/scripts/app-core-new-1.js†L1398-L1419】【F:src/scripts/app-session.js†L11753-L11783】

The Help Center’s console verification callout mirrors these commands so crews have the checklist available directly inside the offline dialog alongside export and rehearsal guidance.【F:index.html†L3899-L3920】 A dedicated **Monthly data health check** sequence now lives beside the data safety callout so teams rehearse settings, exports, offline reloads and rehearsal restores from the same dialog without missing any safeguard.【F:index.html†L3019-L3040】【F:src/scripts/app-core-new-1.js†L10252-L10319】

Contextual help inside **Share** now spells out the full safeguarding routine: the export tooltip reminds crews to file every JSON bundle alongside redundant backups before they close the planner, and the import tooltip highlights the preview step so no one overwrites the wrong project mid-rehearsal.【F:src/scripts/translations.js†L1419-L1434】【F:src/scripts/translations.js†L2872-L2887】【F:src/scripts/translations.js†L4331-L4346】【F:src/scripts/translations.js†L5795-L5810】【F:src/scripts/translations.js†L7269-L7284】【F:src/scripts/app-setups.js†L1347-L1369】

Record the outputs (or screenshots) in your verification log, and store them alongside the exported files so any teammate can confirm the same safeguards were present.

## When to run this checklist

- **New workstation provisioning.** After cloning the repository, run every workflow in the matrix while offline to prove the local cache, locally stored Uicons and persistence helpers all loaded correctly.
- **Pre-travel checks.** Before leaving a controlled environment, repeat the matrix to ensure the latest backups, bundles and share links travel with you and that the runtime guard still reports a clean bill of health.
- **Post-update verification.** When documentation or translations change, run the matrix to confirm instructions still match the UI. Update help entries and localized READMEs if labels or button names shifted.
- **Incident investigations.** If autosaves pause or imports warn about mismatches, perform each workflow in an isolated profile, export fresh backups, and attach the recorded outputs to your incident log before applying a restore.

Keeping this reference near the workstation ensures crews rehearse the exact same offline workflows the application enforces in code, preserving user data at every step.
