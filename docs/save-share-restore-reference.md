# Save, Share, Import, Backup & Restore Reference

This reference details every safeguard that protects user data across save,
autosave, share, import, backup and restore workflows. Use it alongside the
[Operations Checklist](operations-checklist.md) when training crews or auditing
workstations.

## Save & autosave

- **Manual save trigger:** Press **Save**, **Enter** on focused inputs, or
  `Ctrl+S` / `⌘S`. `app-session.js` dispatches a structured save event which
  `modules/persistence.js` clones and persists.
- **Critical storage guard:** During application initialization,
  `ensureCriticalStorageBackups()` mirrors critical keys (projects, gear rules,
  rehearsal preferences and guardian state) to a safeguarded namespace before
  any autosave or backup work executes. The guard runs before the first
  autosave cycle and again whenever the runtime detects missing mirrors, so
  the autosave ledger always references a valid snapshot. Cross-reference
  `getLastCriticalStorageGuardResult()` when compiling verification packets to
  document the guard run and the mirrored keys.
- **Autosave cadence:** Fires after ~50 changes or 10 minutes of inactivity.
  Each run logs to the autosave ledger accessible from **Settings → Data & Storage → Latest activity**, where the **Latest activity** timeline lists timestamps for manual saves, autosaves and guardian events alongside the latest guard evidence.
- **Redundant mirrors:** `storage.js` keeps timestamped mirrors so reverting to a
  previous autosave never touches live data directly.

## Backup

- **Planner backup:** **Settings → Backup & Restore → Backup** exports
  `planner-backup.json`, capturing all projects, favorites, automatic gear rules
  and preferences.
- **Checksum discipline:** Generate SHA-256 hashes for each backup and store them
  with physical copies.
- **Archive storage:** Keep at least two copies (primary + offsite). Log
  locations in `review-findings.md` and the verification packet manifest.
- **Guard verification artifacts:** Attach the most recent
  `getLastCriticalStorageGuardResult()` dump and corresponding autosave ledger
  entry to the backup record so auditors can confirm the mirrored keys existed
  before the export.

## Share & import

- **Project export:** From the selector, choose **Export Project**. The bundle
  includes project data, referenced custom devices, runtime estimates and (if
  selected) automatic gear rules. Favorites and other global data remain
  local—ship a full planner backup alongside the bundle when those must travel.
- **Share workflow:** Copy the bundle to the receiving workstation via physical
  media. No network transfer is required.
- **Import path:** Use **Settings → Backup & Restore → Restore rehearsal** to
  load bundles into the sandbox before promoting.
- **Diff review:** The restore sandbox displays differences; capture screenshots
  and attach them to the verification log.

## Restore

- **Sandbox first:** All imports land in the sandbox. Operators must explicitly
  promote data to avoid overwriting live projects.
- **Factory reset safeguard:** Resetting automatic gear rules downloads the
  current preset library before any defaults are restored. Keep the file with
  other verification artifacts.
- **Promotion safety:** Before promotion the runtime clones current live data to
  a timestamped backup slot. Reverting is always possible.
- **Verification:** After promotion, confirm autosave ledger logs the restore and
  manual save to cement the state.

## Failure recovery

| Scenario | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Autosave missing | Load the latest planner backup, restore via sandbox, then check timestamped mirrors for newer data. |
| Bundle corrupt | Use checksum log to identify mismatch, fetch redundant copy from offsite media. |
| Restore mismatch | Compare schema using `modules/helpers/schema/`; update docs and contact engineering before retrying. |
| Service worker stale | Run cache reset (Settings → Offline & Cache), reload offline and repeat restore. |
| Critical storage guard uncertainty | Confirm the latest guard run succeeded: review the structured `storage` logger (mirrored to the console as `Critical storage guard mirrored backup copies`) and **Settings → Data & Storage → Backup guardian** for a green "Mirrored" status with the same timestamp. Capture the `getLastCriticalStorageGuardResult()` output and autosave ledger entry for the verification packet. If errors appear, halt promotions, re-run the guard from the guardian row, collect error stack traces, and escalate to engineering with the captured evidence. |

## Documentation alignment

- Update this reference whenever persistence logic, UI labels or rehearsal
  behaviour changes.
- Sync instructions with README translations and help topics.
- Store the updated doc in the verification packet alongside the evidence listed
  above.
