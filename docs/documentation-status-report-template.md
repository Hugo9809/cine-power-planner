# Documentation Status Report Template

Use this template to capture the state of documentation, translations and
offline rehearsals for a specific release or audit. File the completed report
with the verification packet, archived backups and translation exports.

## 1. Release details

- **Date:**
- **App build / commit hash:**
- **Workstation(s) rehearsed:** (Include browser versions and offline mode
  confirmation.)
- **Verification log filename:**
- **Documentation packet filename:**

## 2. Summary of changes

- **Features or safeguards touched:**
- **Documentation updated:** (List files or help topics.)
- **Translations updated:** (List locales and export filenames.)
- **Testing completed:** (Reference [Testing Plan](testing-plan.md) sections.)
- **Service worker / asset changes:**

## 3. Offline rehearsal evidence

| Workflow | Evidence (file, screenshot, console log) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual save |  |  |
| Autosave cadence |  |  |
| Planner backup export |  |  |
| Planner backup restore |  |  |
| Project share/import |  |  |
| Automatic gear preset save/restore |  |  |
| Service worker cache refresh |  |  |
| Translation export/import |  |  |

## 4. Documentation coverage

Reference the [Documentation Coverage Matrix](documentation-coverage-matrix.md)
and note outstanding tasks or translation gaps here. Include links to the
[Translation Guide](translation-guide.md) entries that still require human
review.

## 5. Attachments archived

List every file stored with this report (backups, bundles, screenshots,
verification logs, documentation packet, translation exports, repository
snapshot).

## 6. Follow-up actions

Document outstanding tasks, responsible owners and deadlines. Copy items to
[Review Tasks](review-tasks-2025-02-07.md) and track them until closed.
