# Feature Gap Analysis Worksheet

Use this worksheet to track discrepancies between planned functionality,
implemented safeguards and supporting documentation. Update it whenever rehearsals
or audits uncover differences.

## Instructions

1. List each feature or safeguard under review.
2. Note the expected behaviour (from specs, previous releases or documentation).
3. Record the actual behaviour observed during rehearsal, including offline
   findings.
4. Identify missing documentation, translation gaps or automated test coverage.
5. Assign follow-up tasks, owners and deadlines; capture evidence once closed.

## Worksheet

| Feature / Safeguard | Expected behaviour | Actual behaviour | Documentation gap | Translation gap | Tests needed | Owner | Due date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
