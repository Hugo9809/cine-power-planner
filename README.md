an optional pink accent color and a searchable help dialog. Cameras with both
V‑Mount and B‑Mount battery plates are fully supported. See the
language-specific README files for full details.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have Node.js 18 or later installed if you want to lint or test the project.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run the planner offline.
3. Install dependencies and run the full test suite:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   ```
   The `npm test` command runs ESLint, data consistency checks and Jest tests.
