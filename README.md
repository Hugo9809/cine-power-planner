# Cine Power Planner

![Cine Power Planner icon](src/icons/app-icon.svg)

Cine Power Planner is a standalone web app for building, auditing and sharing
professional camera power plans that never leave your machine. Plan Vâ€‘Mount,
Bâ€‘Mount or Goldâ€‘Mount rigs, model runtime expectations, capture project
requirements and export shareable bundlesâ€”entirely inside your browser, even
when you are offline.

## Overview

### Built for crews

The planner was designed with ACs, data wranglers and DoPs in mind. As you add
or swap bodies, battery plates, wireless links and accessories, the total draw
and runtime estimates update instantly. Safety warnings flag overloaded packs,
and gear lists stay tied to project context so nothing slips through when you
hand off prep notes.

### Designed to travel

Open `index.html` directly from disk or host the repository on your internal
networkâ€”no build process, server dependencies or accounts required. A service
worker keeps the whole app available offline, remembers every preference and
only updates when you approve a refresh. Saving, sharing, import, backup and
restore tools are always available and always run locally so user data stays
safe.

### Feature pillars

- **Plan with confidence.** Calculate draw at 14.4â€¯V/12â€¯V (and 33.6â€¯V/21.6â€¯V for
  Bâ€‘Mount), compare compatible batteries and visualize runtime impact through a
  weighted feedback dashboard.
- **Stay production-ready.** Projects capture devices, requirements, scenarios,
  crew details and gear lists; auto-backups, shareable bundles and forced
  refreshes keep data current without sacrificing stability.
- **Work the way you prefer.** Language detection, dark, pink and high-contrast
  themes, typography controls, custom logos and hover help make the interface
  approachable on set and in prep.

## Core Principles

- **Offline always.** The full application, including icons, legal pages and
  helper tools, ships in this repository. Open `index.html` from disk or a
  private intranet and the service worker keeps every locally stored asset in
  sync so you are never forced online.
- **No hidden data paths.** Saves, shareable bundles, imports, backups and
  restores all happen inside the browser. Nothing leaves your machine unless
  you export it.
- **Redundant safety nets.** Manual saves, background auto-saves, periodic
  auto-backups, forced pre-restore backups and human-readable JSON exports work
  together so user data cannot disappear silently.
- **Predictable updates.** Refreshes only apply when you trigger them. Cached
  versions remain available until you approve a **Force reload**, keeping
  planning sessions stable even when crews stay offline for extended periods.
- **Consistent presentation.** Locally bundled Uicons, OpenMoji assets and
  typography files guarantee identical visuals whether you run the planner on a
  stage workstation or a field laptop with no connectivity.

## Whatâ€™s New

- **Automatic gear rules** â€“ design scenario-triggered additions or removals
  that apply after the generator runs, complete with import/export controls
  and timed backups.
- **Data & storage dashboard** â€“ audit stored projects, gear lists, custom
  devices, favorites and runtime feedback, and review approximate backup size
  without leaving the Settings dialog.
- **Accent and typography controls** â€“ adjust accent color, font size and
  typeface while dark, pink and high-contrast themes persist between visits.
- **Global search shortcuts** â€“ press `/` or `Ctrl+K` (`âŒ˜K` on macOS) to focus
  the feature search instantly, even when the mobile navigation is collapsed.
- **Force reload button** â€“ refresh cached service worker assets without
  deleting projects or devices.
- **Pinned favorites** â€“ star dropdown entries to keep go-to cameras, batteries
  and accessories at the top of selectors and inside backups.
- **Factory reset safeguards** â€“ capture an automatic backup before wiping
  saved projects, custom devices and settings.
- **Custom print branding** â€“ upload a logo that appears in printable overviews
  and exported bundles.
- **Backups that include favorites** â€“ downloads include favorites alongside
  projects, gear lists and custom devices.
- **Interactive project diagram** â€“ drag nodes, zoom, snap to grid and export
  clean SVG or JPG layouts with compatibility indicators.
- **Simplified sharing** â€“ export a single project bundle that restores device
  selections, gear lists, runtime feedback and custom gear in one upload.
- **Refined interface** â€“ refreshed layout, improved contrast and persistent
  diagram popovers on touch make the planner easier to use anywhere.

See the language-specific README files for release details in other locales.

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. (Optional) Serve the folder over HTTP(S) to install the service worker and
   Progressive Web App features:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   # or
   python -m http.server
   ```
   The app then caches itself for offline use and applies updates when you
   approve them.
4. Confirm offline operation by loading the planner once, closing the tab,
   disconnecting from the network (or toggling Airplane Mode) and reopening
   `index.html`. The offline indicator in the header should light up briefly
   while cached files load and the interface should match the last session
   exactly.
5. Create a project, add devices from the dropdowns and generate a printable
   overview or gear list to brief collaborators. Use the runtime dashboard to
   verify battery expectations before you export.
6. Visit **Settings â†’ Backup & Restore â†’ Backup** before closing your first
   session so you have a baseline snapshot to compare against future changes.
   Import that backup into a private browser profile to confirm the restore
   path works end to end.
7. Practice exporting a project bundle and re-importing it on another machine
   or browser profile. Verifying the full save â†’ share â†’ import loop in advance
   keeps teams confident that no data will be lost when you are offline on set.

## Everyday Workflow

Use Cine Power Planner end-to-end with the following routine:

1. **Create or load a project.** Select an existing setup or type a new project
   name and press Enter (or click **Save**). The active project name appears in
   gear lists, printable overviews and exports.
2. **Add cameras, power and accessories.** Choose devices from categorized
   dropdowns. Type-to-filter search, pinned favorites and the global shortcut
   `/` (or `Ctrl+K`/`âŒ˜K`) jump straight to the gear or feature you need.
3. **Verify power and runtime.** Monitor draw warnings, compare compatible
   batteries and review the runtime dashboard to see how temperature, codec,
   frame rate and other factors influence field data.
4. **Capture project requirements.** Fill out crew details, scenarios, handles,
   matte box preferences and monitoring layouts so generated lists reflect the
   full production context. Fork buttons duplicate entries for faster data
   entry. When specific scenarios demand bespoke kits, open **Settings â†’
   Automatic Gear Rules** to layer custom additions or removals before
   generating exports.
5. **Export or archive the plan.** Generate the gear list, export a planner
   backup or download an exportable project bundle before heading to set.
   Backups include custom devices, runtime feedback and favorites.
6. **Verify offline readiness.** Toggle the offline switch on your router or
   device, refresh the planner and confirm that the project, settings and gear
   lists all remain accessible. Restore from the most recent backup if anything
   looks out of sync.

## Saving & Project Management

- **Manual saves keep versions explicit.** Enter a project name in the header
  field and press **Enter** or click **Save** to capture the current state. Each
  manual save preserves devices, requirements, gear lists, favorites, diagram
  layouts and runtime observations.
- **Auto-saves protect in-progress work.** While a project is open the planner
  writes incremental changes in the background. Timestamped `auto-backup-â€¦`
  versions appear in the project selector every 10 minutes so you can roll back
  without leaving the interface.
- **Reveal auto backup snapshots on demand.** Toggle **Settings â†’ Backup &
  Restore â†’ Show auto backups** to temporarily display the timestamped safety
  copies in the project selector when you need to restore one manually.
- **Renaming duplicates on purpose.** Editing the active project name and
  pressing **Enter** creates a branched copy. Use this when you want to compare
  alternate builds or keep both day and night configurations side by side.
- **Switching projects is non-destructive.** Select another entry from the
  project menu to load it instantly. The planner preserves scroll position and
  unsaved form inputs for the new project so you can review or edit without
  re-entering data.
- **Deletion requires confirmation.** Use the trash icon in the selector to
  remove unused versions. Youâ€™ll be asked to confirm before anything leaves the
  browser, ensuring you do not lose a project by accident.

## Sharing & Imports

- **Project bundles travel light.** Click **Export Project** to download a
  `.cpproject` file containing the active project, favorites and any referenced
  custom devices. Send it via your preferred secure channel; recipients can
  import without needing internet access.
- **Automatic gear rules travel with bundles.** Decide whether to include your
  rules during export; teammates who import the bundle can ignore them, apply
  them only to the imported project or merge them into their global ruleset.
- **Restores are double-buffered.** Importing a bundle prompts you to save a
  backup of your current environment first. After choosing the bundle file, the
  planner validates its schema, merges new devices and places the restored
  project at the top of the selector.
- **Cross-device workflows stay offline.** To move a plan to a workstation with
  no connectivity, copy `index.html`, `script.js`, `devices/` and your backup or
  bundle files onto removable media. Launch from disk, import the bundle and
  continue planning without touching external networks.
- **Export responsibly.** Review the exported JSON before distributing it to
  make sure no extra projects or notes are included. The structure is human
  readable so you can redact or duplicate entries as needed.
- **Synchronize with checklists.** When a teammate sends you an updated bundle,
  import it, review the `Updated at` timestamps in the sidebar and archive the
  previous bundle in your storage system to maintain a clear history.
- **Share without losing context.** Bundles remember language, theme, custom
  logo and other personalization choices so the recipient opens the project in a
  familiar state even if they stay offline.

## Interface Tour

### Quick reference

- **Global search** (`/`, `Ctrl+K`, `âŒ˜K`) jumps to any feature, selector or help
  topicâ€”even when the side navigation is hidden on smaller screens.
- **Help center** (`?`, `H`, `F1`, `Ctrl+/`) provides searchable guides,
  shortcuts, FAQs and an optional hover-help mode so every control explains
  itself.
- **Project diagram** visualizes power and signal paths. Hold Shift while
  exporting to save a JPG snapshot instead of SVG.
- **Battery comparison panel** reveals how each compatible pack performs and
  flags overload risks before you leave prep.
- **Gear list generator** turns selections into categorized tables with tooltips
  for specs, crew emails and scenario-driven accessories.
- **Offline indicator and Force reload** badges show connectivity status and
  refresh cached assets without touching saved data.

### Top bar controls

- A keyboard-friendly skip link, offline indicator and responsive branding keep
  navigation accessible across devices.
- The global search bar focuses with `/` or `Ctrl+K` (`âŒ˜K` on macOS), opens the
  side menu on mobile and clears with Escape.
- Language, dark mode and pink mode toggles sit beside the Settings dialog,
  which exposes accent color, font size, font family, high-contrast mode, custom
  logo uploads plus backup, restore and factory reset tools that always save a
  backup first.
- The Help button opens a searchable dialog and can be triggered at any time
  with `?`, `H`, `F1` or `Ctrl+/`.
- The ðŸ”„ **Force reload** button removes cached assets and reloads the app
  without erasing projects or runtime data.

### Navigation and search

- On small screens, a collapsible side menu mirrors the main sections for quick
  navigation.
- Every dropdown and editor list includes inline search and supports type-to-
  filter interactions. `/` or `Ctrl+F` (`âŒ˜F` on macOS) focuses the nearest
  search field.
- Star icons pin favorite devices so they stay at the top of selectors and
  persist across sessions and backups.

## Customization & Accessibility

- Switch among light, dark, pink and high-contrast themes; accent color, base
  font size and typeface can be tuned in Settings and persist offline.
- A skip link, focus-visible controls and responsive layout keep navigation
  smooth on keyboards, tablets and phones.
- Keyboard shortcuts cover global search (`/`, `Ctrl+K`, `âŒ˜K`), help (`?`, `H`,
  `F1`, `Ctrl+/`), saving (`Enter`, `Ctrl+S`, `âŒ˜S`), dark mode (`D`) and the pink
  accent (`P`).
- Hover-help mode turns every button, field, dropdown and header into an
  on-demand tooltip so new users can self-teach the interface.
- Upload a custom logo for printed overviews, configure monitoring defaults and
  set preferred requirement presets so deliverables match production branding.
- Fork buttons in gear list forms duplicate entries, while favorites keep
  frequently used devices in reach.

## Data Safety & Offline Operation

- A service worker caches every asset so the planner runs offline and applies
  updates only when you approve them via **Force reload**.
- Projects, runtime submissions, favorites, custom devices, theme selections and
  gear lists live in browser storage. Browsers that support persistent storage
  receive an automatic retention request to reduce eviction risk.
- Opening the repository directly from disk or serving it internally keeps
  sensitive data off external networks. All exports are human-readable JSON so
  you can audit what leaves the machine.
- The header shows an offline indicator whenever connectivity drops, and the
  Force reload control refreshes cached files without touching saved work.
- Clearing the siteâ€™s data or using **Factory reset** removes local entries only
  after exporting a backup automatically, ensuring nothing disappears without a
  copy.
- Service worker updates download in the background and wait for your approval.
  When the **Update ready** toast appears, finish your current edits, trigger a
  manual backup, then click **Force reload** so fresh assets load alongside your
  preserved data.
- Storage lives inside IndexedDB with small preferences mirrored to
  `localStorage`. Use your browserâ€™s developer tools to inspect or export raw
  records before making experimental changes or clearing caches.

## Data & Storage Overview

- Open **Settings â†’ Data & Storage** to review everything the planner keeps on
  the current deviceâ€”saved projects, timestamped auto backups, gear list
  snapshots, custom devices, favorites, runtime feedback and the unsaved session
  cache all appear with live counts.
- Each entry clarifies what it represents and, when relevant, lists affected
  categories or whether the session data is currently stored. Empty sections stay
  hidden so you know at a glance when the planner is pristine.
- The summary also estimates backup size using the most recent export, giving you
  a quick check that archives will fit on the storage you bring to set.

## Backup & Recovery

- **Saved project snapshots** â€“ the selector keeps every plan you save and
  creates timestamped `auto-backup-â€¦` entries every 10 minutes while the app is
  open so you can roll back without losing changes.
- **Full planner backups** â€“ **Settings â†’ Backup & Restore â†’ Backup** downloads
  `planner-backup.json` with projects, custom devices, runtime feedback,
  favorites, automatic gear rules and UI state. Restores create a safety copy
  before importing and warn if the file was produced on another version.
- **Automatic gear snapshots** â€“ rule changes trigger timestamped safety copies
  every 10 minutes in **Settings â†’ Automatic Gear Rules**, and you can restore or
  export them if a customization misfires.
- **Factory reset** â€“ wipes stored data only after downloading a backup. Use it
  when you need a clean slate.
- **Hourly reminders** â€“ a background routine prompts an additional backup each
  hour so crews always have a recent snapshot ready to archive.
- **Verification loop** â€“ after every critical backup, re-import it into a
  separate browser profile or private window, confirm projects and gear lists
  match expectations, then delete the temporary profile. This routine catches
  corrupted files before they matter.
- **Secure storage habits** â€“ label exported backups with the project name and
  timestamp, then store them on redundant media (RAID volume, encrypted thumb
  drive, optical disc) according to your productionâ€™s data policy.
- **Compare before overwriting** â€“ when restoring from an older file, download a
  fresh backup of the current state first. Use a JSON-aware diff tool to review
  differences so you can merge notes manually if needed.

## Data Integrity Drills

Treat data protection as an ongoing habit so no crew member ever wonders whether
the latest save or export is trustworthy. Pair the backup options above with a
repeatable verification loop:

- **Pre-flight validation (daily or before major edits).** Create a manual save,
  export both a planner backup and a `.cpproject` bundle, then import each file
  into a private browser profile. Confirm projects, automatic gear rules,
  favorites and runtime dashboards match the source machine before deleting the
  verification profile. This proves the full save â†’ share â†’ import chain is
  intact.
- **Offline rehearsal (weekly or before travel).** Launch the planner, trigger a
  manual backup, disconnect from all networks and reload `index.html`. Verify
  the offline indicator appears, locally stored Uicons and other assets stay
  crisp and the imported verification project opens without errors. Reconnect
  only after the restored project is confirmed.
- **Change control check (after updating data or scripts).** When devices,
  automatic rules or helper tools change, run `npm test` to rebuild confidence,
  then repeat the pre-flight validation above. Archive the passing backup with a
  changelog entry so future crews know which revisions were certified for
  offline work.
- **Redundancy rotation (monthly or before archiving).** Store the most recent
  planner backup, a verified `.cpproject` bundle and a ZIP of the repository on
  at least two physical media. Rotate which copy you open for spot-checks so you
  catch media degradation before it causes data loss.

## Operational Checklists

Use the following repeatable routines to keep projects, backups and offline
assets in sync on every machine that runs Cine Power Planner. Each checklist is
designed so crews can confirm that saving, sharing, importing, backup and
restore paths all function before heading to set and again before wrapping. A
print-friendly version lives in `docs/operations-checklist.md` for quick field
reference.

### Pre-shoot readiness

1. **Confirm the right repository revision.** Open `index.html`, press the
   **Force reload** button and verify the app reports the expected version in
   **Settings â†’ About**. Launch the legal pages once to warm up locally stored
   Uicons, OpenMoji artwork and typography files.
2. **Load critical projects.** Open the active production plan plus a recent
   `auto-backup-â€¦` snapshot. Confirm gear lists, runtime feedback and favorites
   appear correctly in both.
3. **Exercise the save pipeline.** Make a small edit, press `Enter` or
   `Ctrl+S`/`âŒ˜S` to save, then export a `planner-backup.json` file. Restore that
   backup into a private browsing window or secondary profile and confirm the
   project selector matches the source machine.
4. **Test sharing flows.** Export a `.cpproject` bundle, import it into the
   verification profile and ensure automatic gear rules, custom devices and the
   offline indicator load as expected. Delete the profile afterwards.
5. **Simulate no-connectivity operation.** Disconnect from the network or toggle
   Airplane Mode, refresh the planner and confirm the offline badge appears,
   icons stay crisp and previously verified projects remain accessible.
6. **Archive sign-off artifacts.** Store the verified backup, bundle and a copy
   of the repository ZIP on redundant media so the crew can rebuild the exact
   environment even without internet access.

### Wrap-day handoff

1. **Capture a final manual backup.** With the project still open, export a
   `planner-backup.json` file plus the latest `.cpproject` bundle and label them
   with the date, location and shoot day.
2. **Validate imports.** Restore both files on a verification machine to ensure
   no corruption occurred during export. Keep the verification instance offline
   to mimic field conditions.
3. **Log changes for the archive.** Record which auto backups were promoted to
   manual saves, which custom devices were added and which automatic gear rules
   changed. Store the notes alongside the backups so future crews understand the
   delta.
4. **Refresh cached assets intentionally.** Once everything is archived, trigger
   **Force reload** so the next session starts with current assets, then open the
   help dialog and legal pages to recache any large documents before going
   offline again.
5. **Hand off redundant media.** Deliver encrypted copies of the backups,
   bundles and repository snapshot to the productionâ€™s storage team and retain a
   second copy per your organizationâ€™s data retention policy.

## Gear Lists & Reporting

- Click **Generate Gear List** to expand selections and project requirements into
  categorized packing tables. Lists refresh automatically when data changes.
- Entries are grouped by category with duplicates merged. Scenario selections add
  matching rigging, weather protection and specialty accessories so the printed
  kit reflects reality.
- Automatic gear rules execute after the generator finishes, inserting
  scenario-specific additions or removals so exports reflect bespoke crew
  preferences without editing JSON by hand.
- Lens rows include front diameter, weight, minimum focus, rod requirements and
  matte box components. Battery rows account for calculator counts and required
  hot-swap hardware.
- Crew details, monitoring configurations, video distribution preferences and
  custom notes appear in exports so departments stay aligned.
- Gear lists save with the project, appear in printable overviews, live inside
  shareable project files and can be removed with **Delete Gear List** if you
  want a fresh start.

## Automatic Gear Rules

Settings â†’ **Automatic Gear Rules** lets you fine-tune every generated packing
list without editing JSON exports manually:

- Build rules that only trigger when selected **Required Scenarios** are active.
  Each rule can have an optional label for quick scanning in the settings list.
- Add equipment with explicit category and quantity values or pick **Custom
  Additions** for reminders, specialty kits or callouts. Matching remove rules
  hide specific rows the generator would normally include.
- Rules run after built-in accessory packs so they stack cleanly with default
  planner logic and flow through to printable gear lists, project backups and
  shareable bundles.
- Saving a gear list stores the active rule set with the project. Loading that
  projectâ€”or importing a bundleâ€”restores its rule scope so scenario tweaks stay
  attached to the plan.
- Export or import the rule set as JSON, reset to the factory additions when you
  need a clean baseline and fall back to the automatic history captured every 10
  minutes if edits go sideways.

## Runtime Intelligence

User-submitted runtimes feed a weighted model so estimates match field
experience:

- Temperature adjustments scale from Ã—1 at 25â€¯Â°C to Ã—1.25 at 0â€¯Â°C, Ã—1.6 at âˆ’10â€¯Â°C
  and Ã—2 at âˆ’20â€¯Â°C.
- Resolution multipliers: â‰¥12K Ã—3, â‰¥8K Ã—2, â‰¥4K Ã—1.5, â‰¥1080p Ã—1, lower scaled
  relative to 1080p.
- Frame rate scales linearly from 24â€¯fps (for example, 48â€¯fps = Ã—2).
- Wiâ€‘Fi enabled adds 10â€¯%.
- Codec factors: RAW/BRAW/ARRIRAW/R3D/CinemaDNG/Canon RAW/Xâ€‘OCN Ã—1; ProRes Ã—1.1;
  DNx/AVID Ã—1.2; All-Intra Ã—1.3; H.264/AVC Ã—1.5; H.265/HEVC Ã—1.7.
- Monitor entries below specified brightness are weighted by their brightness
  ratio.
- Final weighting reflects how much of the total draw comes from each component
  so similar rigs carry more influence.
- A dashboard sorts entries by weight, shows contribution percentages and flags
  outliers for quick evaluation.

| ðŸ”„ button | Force reload cached assets. | Also accessible via **Settings â†’ Force reload** without erasing projects. |

## Localization

New locales can be previewed immediatelyâ€”no build step required. To translate
the planner:

1. Duplicate the closest language README as `README.<lang>.md` and translate the
   documentation.
2. Add UI strings to `translations.js` by copying an existing language block and
   translating each value. Preserve formatting placeholders such as `%s`.
3. Provide translated static pages (privacy policy, imprint) by copying the
   relevant HTML files.
4. Run `npm test` to ensure linting, data validation and Jest suites pass before
   submitting a pull request.

## Install as an App

Cine Power Planner is a Progressive Web App:

1. Open `index.html` in a supported browser.
2. Use the browserâ€™s **Install** or **Add to Home Screen** option.
   - **Chrome/Edge (desktop):** Click the install icon in the address bar.
   - **Android:** Open the browser menu and choose *Add to Home screen*.
   - **iOS Safari:** Tap the share icon and select *Add to Home Screen*.
3. Launch the app from your applications list. The installed version works
   offline and updates automatically once you approve a refresh.

## Device Data Workflow

Device catalogs live under `devices/`. Each file groups related equipment so
changes are easy to audit in version control and inside the app. When editing
the dataset, run helper scripts before committing:

```bash
npm run normalize
npm run unify-ports
npm run check-consistency
npm run generate-schema
```

`npm run normalize` cleans connector names and expands shorthand entries.
`npm run unify-ports` standardizes connector labels. `npm run
check-consistency` confirms required fields are present, and `npm run
generate-schema` rebuilds `schema.json` so the interface reflects the latest
data. Iterate quickly with the data-focused Jest project:

```bash
npm run test:data
```

Add `--help` to any helper command for usage notes and review generated JSON
diffs before opening a pull request. `npm run help` prints a summary of all
available scripts.

## Development

Set up with Node.js 18 or later. After cloning the repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint     # run ESLint alone
npm test
```

`npm test` runs ESLint, data consistency checks and the Jest suite sequentially
(`--runInBand`, `maxWorkers=1`) to reduce memory usage while still failing fast.
Run targeted suites while iterating:

```bash
npm run test:unit   # module-level logic and storage helpers (1 GB heap cap)
npm run test:data   # static dataset validations (1 GB heap cap)
npm run test:dom    # lightweight DOM utilities (1.5 GB heap cap)
npm run test:script # reduced smoke checks for script.js (3 GB heap cap)
```

### Legacy browser bundle

Run `npm run build:legacy` after modifying files in `src/scripts/` or `src/data/`
to regenerate the transpiled ES5 bundle served to older browsers. The command
rebuilds everything inside `legacy/` and refreshes the local polyfill copies so
offline usage stays reliable.

### File structure

```
index.html                 # Main HTML layout
src/styles/style.css       # Core styles and layout
src/styles/overview.css    # Printable overview styling

```

## Troubleshooting

- **Service worker stuck on an old version?** Click **Force reload** or perform a
  hard reload in your browserâ€™s developer tools to update cached assets without
  deleting saved projects.
- **Missing data after closing the tab?** Ensure the site has storage access.
  Private browsing modes or restrictive tracking protections can block
  persistence.
- **Downloads blocked?** Allow multiple downloads so backups and shareable
  bundles can save to disk.
