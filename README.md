# Cine Power Planner

![Cine Power Planner icon](icon.svg)

Cine Power Planner is a standalone web app for planning professional camera rigs powered by Vâ€‘Mount, Bâ€‘Mount or Goldâ€‘Mount batteries. It calculates total power draw, checks that batteries can safely deliver the required output, and estimates how long your project will run. The tool runs entirely in the browser and even works offline.

No build step is requiredâ€”open `index.html` in your browser and start planning immediately. Serving the repository over HTTP(S) installs a service worker so that future visits work offline and pick up updates automatically.

## Translations

Documentation is available in multiple languages. The app detects your browser language on first load, and you can switch languages in the top right corner:

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ [English](README.en.md)
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª [Deutsch](README.de.md)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ [EspaÃ±ol](README.es.md)
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ [Italiano](README.it.md)
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [FranÃ§ais](README.fr.md)

Contributions for additional languages are welcome. To add a translation:

1. Create `README.<lang>.md` with the translated documentation.
2. Extend `translations.js` with the new locale strings so the interface can render the language.
3. Include both changes in your pull request.

- Customize the device database with your own gear, import or export it as JSON, and revert to the bundled defaults at any time.
- Jump to features, device selectors, or help topics with the global search field, star favorites to pin go-to devices, and type directly inside dropdowns to filter instantly.
- Tailor the interface with language detection, dark or playful pink themes, high contrast mode, accent color, and typography controls, all stored locally.
- Work completely offline with a service worker, persistent storage, and a force reload button to refresh cached assets without losing data.

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. (Optional) Serve the folder over HTTP to enable the service worker and Progressive Web App features:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   # or
   python -m http.server
   ```
   The planner then works fully offline and updates automatically.

## Interface Overview

### Top bar controls

- A skip link, offline indicator, and responsive branding keep the interface accessible across devices; the offline badge appears whenever the browser loses its connection.
- The global search bar jumps to features, device selectors, or help topicsâ€”press Enter to navigate to the highlighted result, use Ctrl+K (âŒ˜K on macOS) to focus it from anywhere (the side menu opens automatically on small screens), and use Ã— to clear the query.
- Language, dark mode, and pink mode buttons sit alongside the Settings dialog, which exposes accent color, font size, font family, high contrast, and custom logo uploads plus backup, restore, and Clear Local Cache tools.
- The Help button opens a searchable dialog with step-by-step sections, keyboard shortcuts, FAQs, and an optional hover-help mode; it can also be triggered with ?, H, F1, or Ctrl+/ even while typing.
- The Force reload button (ðŸ”„) removes cached service worker files and refreshes the app without touching saved projects or device data.

### Navigation and search

- On smaller screens a collapsible side menu mirrors the main sections for quick navigation.
- Every dropdown and editor list includes an inline search box and supports type-to-filter interactions; pressing / or Ctrl+F (âŒ˜F on macOS) focuses the nearest search field.
- Star icons beside selectors let you pin favorite devices so they stay at the top of the list and persist between sessions.

## Customization and Accessibility

- Theme preferences include dark mode, playful pink accents, and a dedicated high-contrast switch for improved readability.
- Accent color, base font size, and typeface can be customised in Settings; choices are applied immediately and remembered with other preferences.
- A keyboard-friendly skip link, focus-visible controls, offline indicator, and responsive layout improve navigation on desktops, tablets, and phones.
- Built-in keyboard shortcuts cover global search (Ctrl+K/âŒ˜K), help (?, H, F1, Ctrl+/), saving (Enter or Ctrl+S/âŒ˜S), dark mode (D), and pink mode (P).
- The hover-help toggle turns every button, field, dropdown, and header into an on-demand tooltip so new users can learn the interface quickly.

## Gear List

The planner expands your selections into a detailed packing table:

- Click **Generate Gear List** to compile chosen gear and project requirements into a categorized table.
- The list refreshes automatically whenever device selections or project details change.
- Entries are grouped by category (camera, lens, power, monitoring, rigging, grip, consumables, etc.) and duplicates are merged with a count.
- Required cables, rigging, and accessories are added automatically for monitors, motors, gimbals, weather scenarios, and specialty setups.
- Scenario selections inject matching gear (for example, *Handheld* + *Easyrig* adds a telescopic handle; *Gimbal* supplies the selected gimbal, friction arms, and sunshades; *Outdoor* adds spigots, umbrellas, and CapIt rain covers; *Vehicle* and *Steadicam* pack in mounts, isolation arms, and suction gear where applicable).
- Lens choices note front diameter, weight, minimum focus, and rod requirements, and add lens supports and matte box components with warnings for incompatible rod standards.
- Battery rows reflect counts from the power calculator and include a hotswap plate or the selected hotswap device when needed.
- Monitoring preferences provide default monitors for each role and bundle cable sets for every screen.
- The **Project Requirements** form feeds the list:
  - **Project Name**, **Production Company**, **Rental House**, and **DoP** appear in the heading of the printed requirements.
  - **Crew** entries capture names, roles, and email addresses so contact lists stay attached to each project.
  - **Prep Days** and **Shooting Days** supply schedule notes and, when paired with outdoor scenarios, suggest weather gear.
  - **Required Scenarios** append matching rigging, gimbals, and weather protection.
  - **Camera Handle** and **Viewfinder Extension** insert the chosen handle parts or extension brackets.
  - **Matte Box** and **Filter** choices inject the selected system with any needed trays, clamp adapters, or filters.
  - **Monitoring Configuration**, **Video Distribution**, and **Viewfinder** settings add monitors, cables, and overlays for each role.
  - **User Button** selections and **Tripod Preferences** are listed for quick reference.
- Items are sorted alphabetically within their category and each exposes a tooltip on hover.
- The gear list appears in printable overviews and shared project files so collaborators see the full context.
- **Save Gear List** stores the current table with the project.
- **Export Gear List** downloads a JSON file; **Import Gear List** restores it.
- **Delete Gear List** removes the saved list and hides the output.
- Gear list forms use fork buttons to duplicate your entries instantly.

## Runtime Data Weighting

User-submitted battery runtimes are combined using a weighted average to better match your project:

- Entries are adjusted for temperature, scaling from Ã—1 at 25â€¯Â°C to Ã—1.25 at 0â€¯Â°C, Ã—1.6 at âˆ’10â€¯Â°C, and Ã—2 at âˆ’20â€¯Â°C.
- Resolution multipliers: â‰¥12K Ã—3, â‰¥8K Ã—2, â‰¥4K Ã—1.5, â‰¥1080p Ã—1, lower scaled relative to 1080p.
- Frame rate scales linearly from a base of 24â€¯fps (e.g., 48â€¯fps = Ã—2).
- Wiâ€‘Fi enabled adds 10â€¯%.
- Codec factors: RAW/BRAW/ARRIRAW/R3D/CinemaDNG/Canon RAW/Xâ€‘OCN Ã—1; ProRes Ã—1.1; DNx/AVID Ã—1.2; All-Intra Ã—1.3; H.264/AVC Ã—1.5; H.265/HEVC Ã—1.7.
- Monitor entries below the specified brightness are weighted by their brightness ratio.
- The final weight reflects how much of the total power draw comes from the camera, monitor, and other devices so that similar rigs count more.
- A dedicated dashboard orders entries by weight and shows the share percentage for each runtime entry.

## Backup and Recovery

Cine Power Planner automatically guards against data loss and gives you manual controls to export your work:

- **Saved project snapshots:** The project selector keeps every setup you save, and the app creates timestamped `auto-backup-â€¦` entries every 10 minutes while it is open. These snapshots appear at the bottom of the list so you can revert to a previous state without overwriting the active project.
- **Full planner backups:** Open **Settings â†’ Backup & Restore** and press **Backup** to download `planner-backup.json`. The file includes saved projects, custom devices, session state, runtime feedback, and favorites via the internal `exportAllData()` routine. Restoring the file automatically saves a safety copy of your current data before importing the new settings and warns when the file was produced with a different app version.
- **Clear Local Cache:** In **Settings â†’ Backup & Restore**, wipe saved projects, custom gear, favorites, and runtime feedback with one click when you need to start over.
- **Regular reminders:** While the planner is running, an hourly background job triggers the same backup export so you always have a recent download prompt as a reminder to archive your data.

## Install as an App

Cine Power Planner is a Progressive Web App and can be installed for quick access:

1. Open `index.html` in a supported browser.
2. Use the browser's **Install** or **Add to Home Screen** option.
   - **Chrome/Edge (desktop):** Click the install icon in the address bar.
   - **Android:** Open the browser menu and choose *Add to Home screen*.
   - **iOS Safari:** Tap the share icon and select *Add to Home Screen*.
3. Launch the app from your applications list. The installed version works offline and updates automatically.

## Offline Use and Data Storage

When served over HTTP(S), Cine Power Planner installs a service worker that caches all files so the planner runs entirely offline and pulls updates in the background. Projects, runtime submissions, and preferences (language, theme, pink mode, and saved gear lists) are stored locally via `localStorage` in your browser. Clearing the site's data in your browser removes all saved information, and the Settings dialog includes a **Clear Local Cache** button for a one-click reset when you need a fresh start. See [Backup and Recovery](#backup-and-recovery) for tips on keeping your data safe.

## Browser Support

Cine Power Planner relies on modern web APIs and is tested in current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Older browsers may lack support for features like installation or offline caching. For the best experience, use a browser with up-to-date Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities.

## Development

Set up a development environment with Node.js 18 or later. After cloning the repository run `npm install` once, then use `npm test` to execute ESLint, data consistency checks, and Jest tests together while you iterate on changes.

### Repository layout

```
index.html       # Main HTML layout
style.css        # Styles and layout
script.js        # Application logic
devices/         # Default device lists by category
storage.js       # LocalStorage helpers
README.*.md      # Documentation in different languages
checkConsistency.js  # Validates device data
normalizeData.js     # Cleans and unifies device entries
generateSchema.js    # Regenerates schema.json from data
unifyPorts.js        # Harmonizes connector names
tests/               # Jest test suite
```

### Install dependencies and run tests

Requires Node.js 18 or later.

```bash
npm install
npm run lint     # run ESLint alone
npm test
```

`npm run lint` executes ESLint without running tests. The `npm test` command then runs ESLint, data consistency checks, and Jest tests.

To run individual suites while iterating you can target specific Jest projects:

```bash
npm run test:unit   # module-level logic and storage helpers
npm run test:data   # static dataset validations
npm run test:dom    # lightweight DOM utilities
npm run test:script # reduced smoke checks for script.js
```

### Update device data

Device definitions live in the files under `devices/`. After modifying these files, run the helper scripts to clean, verify, and regenerate the database:

```bash
npm run normalize
npm run unify-ports
npm run check-consistency
npm run generate-schema
```

`npm run normalize` applies various cleanup routines to unify connector names and expand shorthand entries. `npm run unify-ports` standardizes connector and port labels. `npm run check-consistency` confirms that required fields are present and raises an error if anything is missing. Finally, `npm run generate-schema` rebuilds `schema.json` from the current data.

Add `--help` to any of the above commands for detailed usage, for example:

```bash
npm run normalize -- --help
```
