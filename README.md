# Cine List

![Cine List icon](icon.svg)

Cine List is a standalone web app for planning professional camera
rigs powered by Vâ€‘Mount or Bâ€‘Mount batteries. It calculates total power draw,
checks that batteries can safely deliver the required output, and estimates how
long your project will run. The tool runs entirely in the browser and even works
offline.

No build step is requiredâ€”open `index.html` in your browser and start planning
immediately. Serving the repository over HTTP(S) installs a service worker so
that future visits work offline and pick up updates automatically.

## Translations

Documentation is available in multiple languages. The app detects your browser
language on first load, and you can switch languages in the top right corner:

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ [English](README.en.md)
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª [Deutsch](README.de.md)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ [EspaÃ±ol](README.es.md)
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ [Italiano](README.it.md)
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· [FranÃ§ais](README.fr.md)

Contributions for additional languages are welcome. To add a translation, include a `README.<lang>.md` file and the necessary translation strings in your pull request.

## Recent Updates

- **Persistent diagram popups on touch** â€“ tapping a node on touch devices keeps its popup visible until another node is selected.
- **Aggregated wireless receiver entries** â€“ similar receiver models are grouped to streamline gear selection.
- **Interactive project diagram** â€“ drag devices, zoom, snap nodes to a grid, and export layouts as SVG or JPG.
- **Pink accent theme** â€“ toggle a playful pink highlight that persists between visits or press **P** to switch quickly.
- **Searchable help dialog and hover hints** â€“ open with ?, H, F1 or Ctrl+/ (even while typing), filter topics instantly, press / or Ctrl+F to jump to the search box, browse the built-in FAQ, and hover over any button, field, dropdown or header for a quick explanation.
- **Type-to-search dropdowns** â€“ quickly narrow device lists by typing directly into any selector.
- **Dual Vâ€‘/Bâ€‘Mount support** â€“ choose between plate types on supported cameras and the battery list updates automatically.
- **User runtime feedback** â€“ submit real-world runtimes with environment details to refine estimates.
- **Visual runtime weighting dashboard** â€“ see how temperature, resolution, frame rate and codec affect each runtime report, now sorted by weight with exact share percentages.
- **Gear list generator** â€“ compile selected gear and project requirements with one click.
- **Quick project saving** â€“ press Enter or Ctrl+S (âŒ˜S on macOS) to save a project and the Save button stays disabled until a name is entered.
- **Project requirement saving** â€“ store project requirements with each project so gear lists retain full context.
- **User entry duplication** â€“ gear list forms use fork buttons to copy user fields instantly.

See the language-specific README files for full details.

## Features at a Glance

- Calculate total power consumption, current draw at 14.4â€¯V and 12â€¯V, and estimated battery runtime.
- Runtime estimates draw on a weighted average of user-submitted runtimes for greater accuracy.
- Check that selected batteries can supply the required output.
- See required battery counts for a 10Â h shoot and adjust runtimes for temperature.
- Compare runtimes across all batteries with an optional battery comparison panel.
- Save, load, share and clear projects (project requirements included); import/export them as JSON, and generate gear lists and printable overviews.
- Visualize power and video connections with an interactive diagram.
- Customize the device database with your own gear.
- Automatically selects your browser language on first load, lets you switch languages, toggle dark or playful pink themes, and swap between Vâ€‘ and Bâ€‘Mount plates on supported cameras.
- Works completely offline and offers a searchable help dialog with hover help for every button, field, dropdown and header.

## Runtime Data Weighting

User-submitted battery runtimes are combined using a weighted average to better match your project:

- Entries are adjusted for temperature, scaling from Ã—1 at 25â€¯Â°C to Ã—1.25 at 0â€¯Â°C, Ã—1.6 at âˆ’10â€¯Â°C and Ã—2 at âˆ’20â€¯Â°C.
- Resolution multipliers: â‰¥12K Ã—3, â‰¥8K Ã—2, â‰¥4K Ã—1.5, â‰¥1080p Ã—1, lower scaled relative to 1080p.
- Frame rate scales linearly from a base of 24â€¯fps (e.g. 48â€¯fps = Ã—2).
- Wiâ€‘Fi enabled adds 10â€¯%.
- Codec factors: RAW/BRAW/ARRIRAW/R3D/CinemaDNG/CanonÂ RAW/Xâ€‘OCN Ã—1; ProRes Ã—1.1; DNx/AVID Ã—1.2; Allâ€‘Intra Ã—1.3; H.264/AVC Ã—1.5; H.265/HEVC Ã—1.7.
- Monitor entries below the specified brightness are weighted by their brightness ratio.
- The final weight reflects how much of the total power draw comes from the camera, monitor and other devices so that similar rigs count more.
- A dedicated dashboard orders entries by weight and shows the share percentage for each runtime entry.

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. (Optional) Serve the folder over HTTP to enable the service worker and other Progressive Web App features. You can use any static file server, for example:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   # or
   python -m http.server
   ```
   The planner then works fully offline and updates automatically.

## Gear List

- Click **Generate Gear List** to compile selected gear and project requirements.
- **Save Gear List** stores the current list with the project.
- **Export Gear List** downloads a JSON file; **Import Gear List** restores it.
- **Delete Gear List** removes the saved list and hides the output.
- Gear list forms use fork buttons to duplicate your entries instantly.

## Getting Started

Set up a development environment:

1. Install Node.jsÂ 18 or later.
2. Install dependencies and run the full test suite:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   ```
   The `npm test` command runs ESLint, data consistency checks and Jest tests.

## Install as an App

Cine List is a Progressive Web App and can be installed for quick
access:

1. Open `index.html` in a supported browser.
2. Use the browser's **Install** or **Add to Home Screen** option.
   - **Chrome/Edge (desktop):** Click the install icon in the address bar.
   - **Android:** Open the browser menu and choose *Add to Home screen*.
   - **iOS Safari:** Tap the share icon and select *Add to Home Screen*.
3. Launch the app from your applications list. The installed version works
   offline and updates automatically.

## Browser Support

Cine List relies on modern web APIs and is tested in current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. Older browsers may lack support for features like installation or offline caching. For the best experience, use a browser with up-to-date Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities.

## Development

After cloning the repository, you can inspect or modify the code base.

### File Structure

```
index.html       # Main HTML layout
style.css        # Styles and layout
script.js        # Application logic
devices/         # Default device lists by category
storage.js       # LocalStorage helpers
README.*.md      # Documentation in different languages
checkConsistency.js  # Validates device data
normalizeData.js     # Cleans and unifies device entries
generateSchema.js    # Regenerates schema.json from data
unifyPorts.js        # Harmonizes connector names
tests/               # Jest test suite
```

### Install dependencies and run tests

Requires Node.jsÂ 18 or later.

```bash
npm install
npm run lint     # run ESLint alone
npm test
```

`npm run lint` executes ESLint without running tests. The `npm test` command then runs ESLint, data consistency checks and Jest tests.

### Update device data

Device definitions live in the files under `devices/`. After modifying these files, run the helper scripts to clean and verify the database:

```bash
npm run normalize
npm run check-consistency
```

`npm run normalize` applies various cleanup routines to unify connector names and expand shorthand entries. `npm run check-consistency` confirms that required fields are present and raises an error if anything is missing. Append `--help` to either command for usage details.

## Feedback and Support

If you run into problems, have questions, or want to suggest new features, please open an issue on GitHub. Community feedback helps improve the planner for everyone.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub. Before submitting, run `npm test` to ensure that linting, data consistency checks, and unit tests all pass.

## Acknowledgements

 The planner uses the [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) icon set when a network connection is available and relies on [lz-string](https://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html) to compactly store projects in URLs.
