Suggestions prioritize direct feature and device matches before help topics so navigation lands on controls first. Each entry shows whether it opens a Feature, Action, Device or Help topic so you know what happens before pressing Enter. Exact matches and items you've used recently jump to the top automatically, so your go-to controls stay first. Every suggestion also includes a short description so you can confirm what it will do at a glance. Search also reads the same tooltip and help text shown around controls, so words like \"JSON\" or \"autosave\" still land on the right button even if the label differs. Small typos are forgiven too, so \"bakcup\" still finds Backup or Save. Press Enter to navigate, / or Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on Mac) to focus the search from anywhere, use Escape or × to clear the query, and notice how clearing the field floats your most recently used matches to the top for faster repeats. Prefix your query with \"feature\", \"action\", \"device\" or \"help\" (for example, \"help: battery\") to filter suggestions to that type. Start with \"recent\" or \"history\" (for example, \"recent iso\") to search only items you've used lately before scanning the full catalog. Wrap any phrase in double quotes to force an exact match, so typing \"battery health\" with quotes jumps ahead of broader matches.",

Ogni voce indica se aprirà una Funzione, un'Azione, un Dispositivo o un argomento di Supporto, così sai cosa succede prima di premere Invio. Le corrispondenze esatte e gli elementi usati di recente salgono automaticamente in cima, così i controlli che usi più spesso restano davanti. Ogni suggerimento mostra anche una breve descrizione così sai subito cosa succederà prima di selezionarlo. La ricerca analizza anche gli stessi testi di aiuto mostrati nelle descrizioni, quindi termini come \"JSON\" o \"salvataggio automatico\" portano comunque al pulsante giusto anche se l'etichetta è diversa. Gli errori di battitura minimi vengono ignorati, quindi \"bakcup\" trova comunque Backup o Salva. Premi Invio per navigare, / o Ctrl+K (Cmd+K su Mac) per mettere a fuoco la ricerca ovunque, usa Esc o × per cancellare la ricerca e, quando svuoti il campo, i risultati usati più di recente salgono in cima così ripeti le azioni frequenti più velocemente. Anteponi \"feature\", \"action\", \"device\" o \"help\" alla ricerca (ad esempio \"help: battery\") per filtrare i risultati su quel tipo. Inizia con \"recent\" o \"history\" (ad esempio \"recent iso\") per limitarti agli elementi usati di recente prima di scorrere tutto il catalogo.

Les correspondances exactes et vos choix récents remontent automatiquement en tête afin que vos commandes habituelles apparaissent en premier.

Ajoutez \"feature\", \"action\", \"device\" ou \"help\" (par exemple \"help: battery\") en préfixe pour limiter les résultats à ce type.
