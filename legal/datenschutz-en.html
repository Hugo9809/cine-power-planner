      <h2>Controller</h2>
      <p>Luca Zanner<br>Brünnsteinstraße 5<br>81541 Munich<br>Germany<br>E-mail: <a href="mailto:info@lucazanner.com">info@lucazanner.com</a></p>
      <h2>General information</h2>
      <p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. This application is built as a purely client-side web app and processes only the data that is technically necessary to operate the service. No profiling, tracking or disclosure of data for advertising purposes takes place. The processing principles described here comply with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
      <h2>Server log files</h2>
      <p>When you access the website, technically necessary information is automatically stored in server log files (e.g. truncated IP address, date and time of access, requested resource, user agent). Processing takes place on the basis of Article&nbsp;6(1)(f) UK GDPR in order to ensure the secure operation of the website. The log data is not merged with other data sources and is usually deleted automatically after a short period.</p>
      <h2>Contacting us</h2>
      <p>If you contact us by e-mail, we process the information you provide solely for the purpose of handling your enquiry. Processing is based on Article&nbsp;6(1)(b) UK GDPR where your request relates to pre-contractual measures or the performance of a contract, and otherwise on Article&nbsp;6(1)(f) UK GDPR due to our legitimate interest in responding to enquiries. The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for processing and there are no statutory retention obligations.</p>
      <h2>Local storage &amp; offline functionality</h2>
      <p>The application stores project data and settings exclusively on your device (e.g. in the browser's local storage and in the service worker cache) and does not transmit this information to us. This storage is necessary to buffer the configurations you enter, enable offline use and improve the user experience. The legal basis is Article&nbsp;6(1)(b) UK GDPR in conjunction with Regulation&nbsp;6 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (PECR), as the storage is technically required to provide the features you request. You can delete the locally stored data at any time in the app settings or via your browser.</p>
      <h2>Recipients of data</h2>
      <p>Personal data is only transferred to third parties if this is required to comply with legal obligations or if we use service providers that process personal data on our behalf (e.g. hosting or e-mail providers). These service providers are contractually obliged to comply with data protection requirements.</p>
      <h2>Legal bases for processing</h2>
      <p>If we obtain your consent to process personal data, Article&nbsp;6(1)(a) UK GDPR in conjunction with Section&nbsp;8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 serves as the legal basis. Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures, Article&nbsp;6(1)(b) UK GDPR applies. Insofar as processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, it is carried out on the basis of Article&nbsp;6(1)(f) UK GDPR.</p>
      <h2>Storage duration</h2>
      <p>We store personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes stated or as required by statutory retention obligations under the Data Protection Act 2018. Thereafter, the data is deleted or blocked.</p>
      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>You have the right to obtain information free of charge about the personal data stored about you (Article&nbsp;15 UK GDPR), its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing. You also have the right to rectification (Article&nbsp;16 UK GDPR), erasure (Article&nbsp;17 UK GDPR), restriction of processing (Article&nbsp;18 UK GDPR) and data portability (Article&nbsp;20 UK GDPR). Where we process data on the basis of Article&nbsp;6(1)(e) or (f) UK GDPR, you have the right to object pursuant to Article&nbsp;21 UK GDPR.</p>
      <h2>Right to lodge a complaint</h2>
      <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority, in particular in the United Kingdom with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9&nbsp;5AF, United Kingdom.</p>
      <h2>Updates to this policy</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to adapt this privacy policy when necessary to ensure it always meets current legal requirements or to reflect changes to our services. The latest version is available at any time on this page.</p>
