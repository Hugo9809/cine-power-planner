# Contributing to Cine Power Planner

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üé¨üöÄ By contributing to **Cine Power Planner**, you help make this tool better for all filmmakers.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are mostly suggestions, not hard rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document via a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs üêû

If you find a bug or problem:
- **Search the issue tracker** to see if it‚Äôs already reported. If not, open a new issue.
- **Include details:** Explain the problem and include steps to reproduce it. Add screenshots or error logs if possible.
- **Use a clear title:** e.g., ‚ÄúCalculator crashes when adding custom camera‚Äù.

### Suggesting Features üí°

Have an idea to improve the project?
- Check existing issues or discussions to see if it‚Äôs already been suggested.
- Open a **Feature Request** issue (use the provided template) or start a Discussion to describe your idea.
- Explain the use case and how it would benefit users. If you can, suggest how it might be implemented.

### Improving Documentation üìñ

Not all contributions are code! You can help by:
- Fixing typos or clarifying instructions in the README or docs.
- Writing tutorials or examples for using Cine Power Planner.
- Translating documentation to other languages (if relevant).

If you see something that can be improved, feel free to open an issue or pull request for documentation changes.

## Development Setup

Interested in hacking on the code? Great! Follow these steps to set up a local development environment:

1. **Fork the repository** (click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page) and clone your fork:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cine-power-planner.git
   cd cine-power-planner
Create a branch for your change:
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
Install dependencies for development:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# (Optional) If there are dev/test requirements:
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt 
Make your changes! Ensure code follows our style (we recommend using a linter/formatter like flake8 or black).
Run tests (if tests exist):
pytest
Make sure all tests pass before submitting your PR.
Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.
Push to your fork:
git push origin my-feature-branch
Open a Pull Request on the main repository:
Go to the repository on GitHub and click "Compare & Pull Request".
Fill out the PR template, link any relevant issues (e.g., ‚ÄúCloses #10‚Äù if addressing issue #10), and describe your changes.
Pull Request Guidelines
Discuss first: If your change is large or architectural, it‚Äôs a good idea to open an issue or discussion first to get feedback.
One feature per PR: Keep changes focused. It‚Äôs better to open multiple small PRs than one big PR that does many things.
Include tests: If you add a new feature or fix a bug, please add or update tests to cover the change if possible.
Respect coding standards: Follow the code style of the project (PEP8 for Python, etc.). Ensure your editor respects the project‚Äôs formatting (spaces vs tabs, line endings, etc.).
Update documentation: If your change affects how users use the tool, update the README or any docs accordingly.
Code of Conduct
This project adheres to a Code of Conduct (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainer.
Thank You üôè
Your contributions make Cine Power Planner better for everyone. Thank you for helping out! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out by opening an issue or discussion.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (maintainers) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (including the issue tracker, project discussion boards, chat, and events), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **[your-email@example.com]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders (project maintainers) are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

**1. Correction:**  
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.  
Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**2. Warning:**  
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. The contributor is temporarily banned from interacting with the community (including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct) for a specified period of time. 

**3. Temporary Ban:**  
Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.
